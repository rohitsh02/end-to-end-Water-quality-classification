# end-to-end-Water-quality-classification
This repository contains the source code for a machine learning project that uses end-to-end pipelines to classify water quality sample data.

# Motivation

The End-to-end Water Quality Classification repository is developed to address the need for accurate and efficient water quality testing. The project can be customized to suit different business needs by modifying the machine learning pipeline built using Python language. By using an open-source end-to-end water quality classification pipeline, developers can avoid the time-consuming and costly process of building their machine learning pipeline from scratch.

# Features

The End-to-end Water Quality Classification repo has the following features:

- Data pre-processing pipeline for handling missing values, noisy data, and feature scaling
- An Exploratory Data Analysis tool that allows visualization of pertinent features before modeling
- A machine learning pipeline for water quality classification built using popular libraries such as PyTorch or Scikit-Learn
- A web interface for interacting with the pipelines and accessing the results

# Installation

1. Clone or fork this repository to your local environment
2. Make sure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) and the required dependencies installed in your system.
3. Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Navigate to the module folder and configure the settings available in config.py
5. Start the pre-processing and machine learning pipeline by running the command: python run_pipeline.py

# Usage

To use the End-to-end Water Quality Classification, follow these steps:

1. First, define the water quality sample dataset that you want to use in your analysis
2. Configure the pipeline settings in the config.py files according to your needs
3. Run the machine learning pipeline using the command python run_pipeline.py
4. The pipeline script will use your data to train a classification model and output the results
